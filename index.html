            <img src="./docs/class2.png" style="height: 250px" alt="angle 2 of abby's classroom">
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">I have organized students into groups of 4 desks as I believe that group-work is vital to enriched learning and I want that to be possible any day of the week. I chose to face all desks perpendicularly to the front of the classroom so that the front of the classroom is not the default. I do not want students to each learn to feel like an audience member removed from the teaching “stage”. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">At the back are two standing whiteboard tables (on wheels), which students would be encouraged to use for any kind of work. Similarly, there are 3 beanbag chairs at the back of the classroom which could be moved anywhere in the class. Opposite the whiteboards is a corner table with three soft chairs which students would also be able to use for individual or group work any time that they need a change of environment.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">My desk is at the front of the classroom not because I want to be central but because it takes up space where it would be particularly hard for students to see the whiteboard from. There are plants in each corner of the room which I have chosen in order to help make the space feel inviting and comfortable. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">There are also lamps in the two back corners, as well as string lights on two of the walls. My intention would be to use very little of the overhead lights and instead to use as many soft lights as possible in order to remove the harshness that I find fluorescent lights bring to classrooms. I would also like to feature student work and other resourceful posters on the walls to make the space feel as though it belongs to the students.
