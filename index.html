            <p style="width: 1000px; margin: auto">I want to stray from lecture-based teaching in the Math class. I would like to plan at least two non-traditional (for example group-based, interactive, kinesthetic) activities per week in each class that I teach full-time in the next year.
            </p>

                <tr>

                    <th style="width: 150px">Indicators of Success</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>This goal is important because I believe there are many students who do not like math or consider themselves “incapable” of doing math simply because the teaching style they have experienced in math classes has been non-engaging, didactic, and teacher-centred. I want to change the way students who do not consider themselves skilled in math see their abilities and think about Math in general. I find this to be one of the greatest differences between myself, having pursued post-secondary math, and friends of mine who never liked math at any level of schooling.</td>
                    <td>In lesson planning, I will attempt to come up with a non-didactic activity before anything else. I will use lecture-style teaching if I feel that extra instruction on a topic is needed or that an activity will not be as effective in teaching a concept compared to lecturing, however it will not be my first resort when I am deciding how I am going to teach the content. I could:
                        <br> - ask my students what their favourite kind of work/activity is
                        <br> - resort to my “teaching strategies” list which I have been adding to over the course of this program
                        <br> - use practices from “The Thinking Classroom” when I feel like I am out of ideas
                        </td>
                    <td>I am able to identify two non-traditional activities in my lesson plans for the week. Ideally, by the beginning of each week I will be able to look ahead and know what will be taking place every day in the week.</td>

            <p style="width: 1000px; margin: auto">I want to set clear expectations regarding phone/device usage in my classroom such that it is seen and used as a tool rather than a crutch. I plan on using digital tools such as graphing calculators in my lessons and I do not want to have to micromanage social media usage at the same time; students will be allowed to use their devices freely if they ask in advance; otherwise, they should only be used only for tasks which pertain to the day’s lesson.
            </p>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>This goal is important because I believe that high school is a crucial age for students to learn self-management and technological responsibility. As a member of Gen Z, I personally understand phone addiction and notice that the older I get, the more I wish I learned healthy self-management skills earlier in life than now. For this reason, I think it is important for learners to spend time apart from their devices while they are still developing habits and skills. I think in the big picture, this technological maturity will increase engagement, social-emotional skills, and overall well-being.</td>
                    <td>Some expectations I will communicate with my classes will be:
                        <br> - phones should be set face-down on the corner of students’ desks during class time–especially tests and quizzes
                        <br> - students must ask for permission before using their devices for something other than classwork
                        <br> - during my first couple weeks in any new classroom I will be especially intentional about not letting phone usage “slide” so as to not suggest to students that I do not care to enact my expectations
                        <br> - it will be made clear whenever devices are welcome during/needed for an activity
                        </td>
                    <td>I do not find myself having to manage device usage more than a few times per day. Students will ask for permission to use their devices before getting them out, and in-lesson device usage does not repeatedly result in distraction or wasted time on things other than the tools being used for learning.</td>

            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">I have organized students into groups of 4 desks as I believe that group-work is vital to enriched learning and I want that to be possible any day of the week. I chose to face all desks perpendicularly to the front of the classroom so that the front of the classroom is not the default. I do not want students to each learn to feel like an audience member removed from the teaching “stage”. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">At the back are two standing whiteboard tables (on wheels), which students would be encouraged to use for any kind of work. Similarly, there are 3 beanbag chairs at the back of the classroom which could be moved anywhere in the class. Opposite the whiteboards is a corner table with three soft chairs which students would also be able to use for individual or group work any time that they need a change of environment.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">My desk is at the front of the classroom not because I want to be central but because it takes up space where it would be particularly hard for students to see the whiteboard from. There are plants in each corner of the room which I have chosen in order to help make the space feel inviting and comfortable. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="width: 850px; margin: auto">There are also lamps in the two back corners, as well as string lights on two of the walls. My intention would be to use very little of the overhead lights and instead to use as many soft lights as possible in order to remove the harshness that I find fluorescent lights bring to classrooms. I would also like to feature student work and other resourceful posters on the walls to make the space feel as though it belongs to the students.
